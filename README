Project objectives:
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


Run_analysis.R contains the code that performs the required tasks, and outputs into tidy.txt file
To use, extract UCI data into UCI HAR Dataset folder in the same directory as Run_analysis.R

CodeBook.md explains the main transformations and datasets performed by the analysis file
